Analisis

While schooling is ment for education and is mostly self driven by the studnet and how much time and work they put into it, 
outside factors can lead to a students succses or falure depending on the school and
the inviroment. As a example larger schools tend to have less students who reach academic succsess.
in corelation most schools that have certan titles tend to have more of the problemb catigorys 
as a exampe district schools tend to have a large student count and a large budget for there students
revewing the data shows that schools with more students and large budgets reduces the test scores of the students
this data is also shown to work in the reverce as students that go to charter schools have smaller budgets and are smaller in there student count
tend to do much better in there classes. through this data it can be shown that students who go to schools that 
are charter schools, medium or small in size and dont have large budgets tend to produce students that have the best chances of passing.

However there are always factors that lead to misconseptions in data. these table say nothing about extracurricular activitys what groups or counseling the school offers
just to name a few. While I still belive in my hypothis more data would be needed to conclude spesificly why some schools do better than others.
